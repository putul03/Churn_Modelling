## Introduction
Churn prediction is a critical aspect of customer relationship management for businesses. This project focuses on developing predictive models to anticipate customer churn, allowing businesses to take proactive measures to retain valuable customers.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Implementation of machine learning algorithms for churn prediction.
- Model evaluation using various metrics.
- Sample code for deployment and integration into operational systems.
- Detailed documentation for each step of the project.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/churn-prediction.git
2. Install the required dependencies using:
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage
1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Follow the instructions in the documentation to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.
3. Use the trained model to make churn predictions for new data.

## Data
The dataset will contain some features regarding customer's history of bank for which we are creating this churn model like credit score, geography, gender, age, tenure, balance, no. of product, having credit card or not, is active member? , estimated salary, exited . it also some extra features like row no. and customer id which will be removed during modelling. 

## Modeling


## Evaluation
Describe the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of your churn prediction model. Provide insights into the model's strengths and areas for improvement.
